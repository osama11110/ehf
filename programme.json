    "description": "Well-being societies are those that prioritise the well-being of their citizens over economic growth and profit. According to the World Health Organization, well-being is a positive state experienced by individuals and societies, determined by social, economic, and environmental conditions. It encompasses quality of life and the ability of people and societies to contribute to the world with a sense of meaning and purpose. To deliver well-being societies, the 2021 Geneva Charter for Well-being by the United Nations Organization (UNO) calls for investments in planetary, societal, community, and individual health and well-being. In parallel adjustments are needed to social structures to help people take charge of their lives and health, and a reorientation of societal attitudes and actions in a fundamental way that aligns with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.During this webinar, featuring stakeholders from across the societal spectrum, we explored the fundamentals of a well-being society, and heard from a range of international actors putting well-being at the forefront of their policies.

    "description": "Envision a dedicated Hub that can support EU Member States in accessing EU funds for health reforms!The creation of an EU Resources Hub is the focus of this session, which will showcase the results of a Technical Support Instrument project entitled “Resources Hub for Sustainable Investing in Health”. The project through which the European Commission Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support (DG REFORM) is working with the ministries of health from Austria, Belgium, Slovenia following a joint initiative between, and in partnership with, Expertise France and EU Observatory of Health Systems and Policies, is an example of how to undertake reforms in health systems and best advocate for investments in health against the backdrop of increasing pressure on public budgets.The EU provides a wide range of funds, tools and instruments that could be used for supporting health reforms. However Member States often struggle to identify and access them. Sharing insights gained from the TSI project, this session will discuss how the EU can support Member States in undertaking reforms and making the case for related investment in health and discuss the creation of a Hub to facilitate the use of EU instruments for reforming health systems.",

    "description": "In a digitalised world, social media plays a significant part in the lives of children across Europe. With evidence claiming that both too much or not enough access to social media is negatively affecting children and young adults, concern is mounting about the way that social media is used by young generations.Sensitivity to social media is not linear and varies across demographics. Periods of apparent vulnerability to social media content arise at different developmental periods, with adolescents experiencing significant impacts, alongside a noticeable gender difference. In contrast, online connections for marginalised and vulnerable communities can provide safe social arenas often resulting in supportive mental health factors. Social media and alternative digital formats allow young people to consume content regardless of location and time. With concerns over addictive qualities, unsolicited and unrestricted content, access and regulatory protections, the perceived collapse in children and young person’s mental and physical health and the connection to social media is quickly becoming of widespread concern. Placing the topic firmly on the EHFG agenda, this session aims to open the discussion about the harms, benefits, and safety of a product widely used by children and young people across Europe.",

    "description": "Despite the EU’s leadership in science, a gap persists in translating excellent research into final products. This session examines the EU's role in addressing unmet medical needs for neglected diseases through innovative financing mechanisms. Climate change is introducing diseases like Dengue and malaria to Europe, while rising antimicrobial resistance reduces treatment effectiveness. The erosion of democratic institutions, overstretched healthcare systems, public funding constraints, and post-COVID-19 fatigue highlight the need for EU leadership in global health as a top priority. Introducing pull funding mechanisms such as priority review vouchers will be crucial to transforming research into tangible health and societal benefits and showcase the value of global health investments. The revision of EU pharmaceutical legislation, the new Biotechnology strategy, and the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) offer entry points for these incentives. This discussion will explore ways to strengthen Europe's global health innovation ecosystem to effectively address persistent and emerging health challenges.",

However, the democratically elected policymakers wanting to implement effective NCD policies are often faced with pressure and resistance by the commercial actors.This session will reflect on how political practices of commercial actors have shaped the development and implementation of public health policies in Europe, with a focus on tobacco, alcohol, and nutrition, and discuss the efforts of the public health community to equip policymakers with the necessary skills to respond to the practices and arguments of unhealthy commodity industries. This discussion is urgent in the context of the upcoming NCD High Level Meeting, as well in light of the delayed implementation of the relevant risk factor provisions in the EU Beating Cancer Plan, such as nutrition and alcohol labelling, or the tobacco tax directive proposals.",

    "description": "The health workforce is the beating heart of our health systems. Yet EU countries are struggling to retain and recruit health workers to meet the growing demands for treatment and care. Demographic shifts in the EU—such as an ageing population, declining birth rates, and longer life expectancy — pose critical challenges for our health systems and healthcare workforce. Moreover, the health workforce itself is ageing. How can we inspire and encourage young people to join the health workforce? What will the health workforce of the future look like? How will the climate crisis, digital transformation and AI impact the work and skills needed in the health sector?This session will address some of these questions, including policies and initiatives to improve working conditions, workload management and career prospects. It will also look at promoting workforce planning and training, enhancing skills and education, and leveraging digital and Artificial Intelligence technologies.Join us to hear directly from those on the frontline of treatment and care about the actions that support Member States in addressing health workforce challenges and how to build a more resilient health workforce that can provide high quality treatment and care to all who need it and cope with health crises.",

In the turmoil of evolving population needs and expectations, underpinned by ageing societies and highly complex political contexts, health systems are in need of regeneration. To achieve Universal Health Coverage, a path of renewal grounded in ensuring quality of care is underway in the WHO European Region. By consolidating measures that have proved to be effective and embracing innovative solutions, WHO is helping to drive health system reforms with a focus on a whole-system approach to quality of care. Building on people-centred, effective, and safe care, a systemic approach to quality of care emphasises equity, efficiency, access, and timeliness. Adequate governance, financing, and an empowered workforce are key for successful quality of care. Outcome measurements, supported by a digital, data-driven, and learning culture, work as catalysts, aligning all stakeholders on what really matters to people. This renewed quality of care approach can restore health systems and create an environment where all people thrive.",

    "description": "2024 marks the biggest election year so far in human history, with over 50% of the global population called to the polls. As election results have already shown, populist and autocratic ideas are on the rise, fuelled by a crisis of trust and a creeping disillusionment with the status quo amongst voters: a failure to deliver on promises of addressing key issues from the climate crisis to inequality, conflict, migration, and secure employment. When it comes to health and healthcare systems, democratic institutions and actors often seem to be sleepwalking rather than offering innovative solutions to the critical challenges of overstretched systems and health workforce attrition. And in the meantime, health is being hijacked by commercial interests that prioritise the profits of a few over the health and well-being of many. This plenary will examine different facets of the relationship between democracy and health, exploring why there is growing mistrust in our political institutions vis a vis health systems, and what can be done to restore the balance.",

At the heart of the analysis are multidimensional country profiles that offer insights into different quality of care dimensions, health system functions, and population health outcomes. Aggregated data show persistent quality of care and patient safety gaps across different settings, with the most vulnerable populations faring the worst. The findings serve a strong call for action to prioritize quality of care as a driving force for Universal Health Coverage, health system reforms and improved health and societal outcomes.

However, participation is not a panacea and the session will not shy away from exploring the challenges, especially when the scope for action is limited.Democratic decision-making needs a balance between direct and indirect (representative) elements to weigh up interests and avoid either dominance of elites or lobbies or the construction of a \"façade\" and \"tokenism\", using participation for symbolic gestures and public relations.The speakers in this session will use examples to show how this plays out in reality by highlighting the balance between representative elements and avoiding mock participation. Both, success stories and failures will be discussed interactively with speakers and audience to reflect on what resources and structures are needed for meaningful participation with real impact on policy and practice.",

The UK government has so far chosen the opposite approach, relying on existing tools to assess and approve AI in each domain and hoping for a competitive advantage from a lighter regulatory burden. This is a rare example of intentional health policy divergence between the UK and the EU since Brexit, which has nevertheless had wider impacts across a range of issues including workforce and medicines. With a new Parliament and Commission in the EU, and a new government in the UK, now is a pivotal moment to rebuild bridges – or for the divergence in AI regulation to be the first step in a deepening divergence.In this breakfast session, we will look at the implications of the different approaches to AI regulation in the EU and the UK, and explore how they will position the EU and the UK compared to other jurisdictions. More broadly, we will have an open discussion about the potential scenarios for EU:UK relations and their implications for health, and what emerges as potential avenues for co-operation and cooperation between the EU and the UK in relation to health.",

Health is therefore at the very heart of the social contract that has evolved in Europe, as recognised in the strong commitment to a Health Union and efforts at strengthening the social union.Previously the social contract for health concentrated on ensuring universal access and affordability of health services. Today it requires a new paradigm, focused on the social, environmental, and digital challenges faced by societies as well as well-being, and the determinants of health. This shift also includes determining the level at which issues can be resolved: national, European, or global.This session will explore the new dimensions of social contracts and the different forms of solidarity they imply, including establishing new bridges between individual and public health.",

    "description": "Europe is entering an era of profound demographic change that will bring a range of societal and political opportunities and challenges. New highs in life expectancy coupled with changing fertility patterns will mean a rapid expansion in the number and share of older people in the population, resulting in societies where there will be fewer working-age people for every retired person, and thus fewer taxpayers to fund public services and state pensions. We will be living longer but not necessarily healthier lives, meaning more health and social care will be required – but who will provide it given that we are already seeing high rates of attrition and dissatisfaction in public services, especially in the healthcare workforce? One option is to improve the working-age-to-retired ratio through higher levels of immigration, but this is not a simple solution, raising numerous ethical and practical questions. Young people will be particularly impacted: they may be compelled to remain employed longer as the ages of eligibility for state pensions rise, to pay higher taxes to fund under-resourced public services, and perhaps to take specific career paths where there are shortages of human labour. Much will depend on our greater adoption of healthy behaviours, a life course approach to health and well-being, and policies to realise the green transition and healthier environments, so that we are living longer actively and in good health. The extent to which medical advances, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies can support us will also be key. Our second plenary will host an inter-generational discussion that will probe some of these multi-faceted issues and consider the implications for health, democracy and intergenerational relations in light of major demographic shifts.",

A major determinant of this problem is systemic, as individuals have easy access to and overconsume ultra-processed foods with high fat, sugar and salt content (HFSS), while they struggle to access nutrient-rich foods, such as vegetables, fruit, wholegrains, healthy fats and sustainable sources of protein.For decades, measures to address this issue have narrowly focused on individual behaviour but there is now overwhelming evidence that malnutrition is the result of a systemic problem. Therefore, systemic policies to make the healthy choice the easiest choice, to identify and change unhealthy food environments, and address food system power imbalances are in urgent need. In this session, we will explore some of the policies needed to transition towards a healthier food system that provides an equal opportunity for all to enjoy their right to nutritious food and health.",

In light of continued cost pressure on health systems of an ageing population, the panel will discuss the societal and economic burden of chronic diseases in Europe and the importance of investing in prevention and improving the efficiency of care.Chronic diseases account for 80% of the EU’s disease burden, threatening the sustainability of our health systems. According to OECD, an additional 1.4% of GDP spending on health could bolster health system resilience. However, health expenditure in 2022, excluding spending on COVID-19, was below 2019 levels. Will adopting a social or public value-based approach strengthen investment decision making for a more sustainable healthcare system?The panel aims to foster an interactive exchange on a robust ethical and economic case for innovative health budgeting, emphasising the return on investment in healthcare.",
